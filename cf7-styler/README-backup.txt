Save time by styling Contact Form 7 once and applying the same design to multiple forms – CF7 WOW Styler keeps them on brand with visual controls and no CSS.

== Description ==

CF7 WOW Styler helps you style your Contact Form 7 forms visually, without writing CSS. You design directly in the browser, see every change in the live preview, and apply the style with one click.

Use CF7 WOW Styler to adjust colors, spacing, buttons, backgrounds (including animated backgrounds), lists, labels, and error messages. The free version is ideal if you want to style one important form, for example your main contact or request form.

See how a plain Contact Form 7 becomes a professional, branded form in seconds.

Many Contact Form 7 users waste time because every new form requires starting over with styling. CF7 WOW Styler solves this: create one design once and reuse it for as many forms as you need—no CSS required.

Design directly in the browser. Watch changes live. Save as a reusable style scheme. Apply it to multiple forms or tweak variations for different pages or campaigns.

Instead of writing CSS snippets or hiring developers, click together colors, spacing, buttons, backgrounds, and layouts. Done.

== Why Choose CF7 WOW Styler? ==

CF7 WOW Styler is for users who already use Contact Form 7 and want professional styling without learning CSS. Start from a template, customize with many style settings, then reuse and adapt for other forms.

Live preview shows changes instantly. Split view lets you compare published vs. in-progress versions side by side.

Works with all themes, page builders, and browsers. Your theme's fonts and colors become the starting point—change only what matters.

== One Form vs. Many Forms ==

**Free Version:** Perfect for one fully styled form.
