Save time by styling Contact Form 7 once and applying the same design to multiple forms – CF7 WOW Styler keeps them on brand with visual controls and no CSS.

== Description ==

**Style your Contact Form 7 forms visually – no coding required.**

Many website owners struggle with Contact Form 7 forms that look generic and don't match their brand. Creating professional-looking forms usually means either hiring a developer or learning CSS. With CF7 WOW Styler, you get a visual styling interface that lets you design forms directly in your browser—no code, no hassle.

**The Problem CF7 WOW Styler Solves**

When you have multiple Contact Form 7 forms across your site, each one requires separate styling work. Without CF7 WOW Styler, you're stuck with:

- Forms that all look the same, clashing with your brand
- Needing CSS knowledge (or hiring someone) to customize each form
- Difficulty placing multiple differently styled forms on one page
- Page builders that strip out your CSS, breaking your form design
- Time wasted rebuilding form styles for every new form you create

**How CF7 WOW Styler Works**

Create one design. Reuse it everywhere. CF7 WOW Styler lets you:

1. **Style directly in the browser** – No CSS editor needed. Visual controls for colors, spacing, buttons, backgrounds, fonts, and more.
2. **See changes instantly** – Live preview shows every adjustment in real-time.
3. **Save as reusable styles** – Once you've styled a form, save it as a scheme and apply it to other forms in seconds.
4. **Adapt for different purposes** – Tweak the same base style for different forms (contact, support, sales) on the same page.

**Why Choose CF7 WOW Styler?**

CF7 WOW Styler is built for users who already use Contact Form 7 and want professional form design without learning CSS or switching to a new plugin. You keep all your existing forms, integrations, and workflows—you just add beautiful styling.

Live preview shows changes as you make them. Split view lets you compare your published form with your draft side by side. The plugin even pulls your theme's fonts and colors as a starting point, so you only customize what matters.

Works perfectly with all themes, page builders (Elementor, Thrive, Divi, etc.), and modern browsers.

**Who Needs This?**

**One Main Form?** The free version is perfect. Style your primary contact, booking, or support form once and you're done.

**Multiple Forms with Different Purposes?** The Pro version lets you create individual styles for multiple forms—ideal for:

- **WooCommerce shops** – Returns form, support form, invoice questions, feature requests
- **Agencies & service providers** – New client intake, existing client support, project onboarding
- **SaaS & online courses** – Demo requests, bug reports, feature ideas, community feedback

Instead of one long, confusing form with complex conditions, each department gets its own clean form with its own styling and tone.

**What You Can Style**

- **Text:** Colors, fonts, sizes, weights, styles
- **Links:** Colors and hover states
- **Labels:** Styling, sizing, weight
- **Buttons:** Text, background, hover effects, shadows, borders
- **Input fields:** Colors, backgrounds, borders, shadows, opacity
- **Forms:** Padding, margins, borders, shadows, background colors
- **Pro only:** Animated GIFs, background images, opacity control, "one per line" checkboxes/radio buttons, special CSS loading for page builders

**Get Started in 3 Steps**

1. Install and activate CF7 WOW Styler
2. Go to Contact → CF7 Styler in your WordPress admin
3. Select a form and start styling with the visual interface

**Free Version vs. Pro**

**Integrate with Your Marketing Stack**

Use CF7 WOW Styler with other WordPress tools:
